# Happy Birthday Nasa 🚀
This project is inspired by the <a href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/hst_bday/">Hubble Birthday</a> website 🌐, where you add your month and day of birth and it sends you an image corresponding to your birth.

The project is much more personalized because observing the limitation of the previous one in this project you can put your **dd-mm-yyyy** where it not only sends you an image but also a description of what happened on that particular day.

Thanks to NASA for the API 💌 >
